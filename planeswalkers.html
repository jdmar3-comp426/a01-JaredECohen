               Planeswalkers are among the most powerful beings in the Magic The Gathering multiverse. They are the only beings able to traverse between planes. Very few indiviudals are born with the planeswalker spark. In order to access their planeswalking abilities, this spark must be activated, and traumatic events are the most common catalyst for a planeswalker spark to ignite.
