                Planes
            </h1>
            <p>
               Planes are the worlds in the Magic The Gathering multiverse. Planes can vary from infintie expanses of space to empty pocket dimensions. Planes vary extensively in way of life, life forms, and even laws of nature.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Ravnica
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ravnica is a world covered entirely by city. Extremely urbanized and run by powerful law magic, Ravnica is one of the most technologically advanced and unified planes 
                known, with a powerful standing military, extremely advanced science and magic, and a wide-spanning public works and resource 
                generation. Ravnica was once ravaged by war and clan conflicts until a powerful spell called The Guildpact was cast on Ravnica.
                This spell united the plane under ten equally powerful groups who each held sway in different aspects of running the world, making them unable to interfere with one another by establishing strict 
                boundaries and roles for each. These groups are the Boros, Golgari, Izzet, Azorius, Orvhov, Selesnya, Simic, Rakdos, and Gruul, each of which is run by a guild leader.

            <h2>
                Theros
            </h2>
            <p>
                Inspired by Greek mythology, Theros is a plane ruled by a pantheon of gods in the realm of Nyx. Theros has three realms. The surface world, a physical 
                underworld that exists beneath the surface of the world, and a celestial one that exists within the night sky and holds the gods and their creations.  
                Unique in th emultiverse, the belief and devotion of mortals on this plane effect the fabric of Nyx and the gods it houses.
                On the sunny surface of Theros, humanity lives within numerous large city-states known as Poleis. The wilds of Theros contain civilizations of centaurs, satyrs,
                hydras, sphinxes, dragons, sirens, manticores, cyclopes, giants, and pegasi. Off its massive coast are cities of merfolk, sirens, harpies, and enormous kraken. 
                Theros is also home to many heros who perform great deeds in the name of the gods.

            <h2>
                Zendikar
            </h2>
            <p>
                Zendikar is a plane with powerful, primal mana and a rich, varied past. Millenia ago, Zendikar was a stable plane with vibrant life across its landscape. 
                One of the white-aligned native races, the Kor, eventually came to rule the plane and forced all other races into servitude with the use of powerful artifacts. 
                Ruling from bases of power called Skyclaves, the Kor were the de facto power of Zendikar until the rebellion of the sentient races. One by one, the Skyclaves were toppled, and the Kor sent crashing back to the earth, their power forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, a trio of powerful planeswalkers (Ugin, Sorin, & Nahiri) used the natural, vibrant nature of Zendikar as bait to lure the three world-devouring Eldrazi Titans into a trap. 
                They created an advanced network of hedrons to manipulate the leylines of Zendikar and trap the Eldrazi in the physical world, resulting in the plane of Zendikar becoming an ever-shifting plane of chaotic energy.
                Over time, this chaotic twisting of the natural world became known as the Roil, and the unpredictable nature of its natural inhabitants and environment turned Zendikar into a world of adventure and peril for thrill-seekers and treasure hunters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much later, the three Eldrazi Titans were awakened from their slumber and unleashed upon the multiverse.
                The Eldrazi quickly consumed Zendikar, converting the powerful mana of the plane into colorless wastes and annihilating life of the plane. 
                Planeswalkers Jace Beleren, Chandra Nalaar, Gideon Jura, Nissa Revane, and Kiora Atua teamed up to protect the plane and destroy the titans Kozilek and Ulamog.
